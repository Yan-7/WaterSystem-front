Your code looks well-structured and clean. Here are a few suggestions that you might consider:

1. **Error Handling**: You have handled errors well in the API calls, but you might also want to consider what should be displayed to the user in the UI if there is an error. For example, you could show a message in the `Dashboard` component if there is an error loading the plants.

2. **Loading State**: It might be a good idea to show a loading spinner or some other indicator while the plants are being loaded. This can be done by adding another piece of state, e.g. `const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);` and then setting it to `false` once the plants have been loaded.

3. **CSS**: You might want to consider adding some more styling to your components. For example, you could add some padding and margins to space things out a bit more, and you could add some hover effects to the buttons.

4. **Image**: You have hardcoded the image in the `PlantCard` component. If you have different images for different types of plants, you might want to consider passing the image URL as a prop to the `PlantCard` component.

5. **Status Color**: The `getStatusColor` function is duplicated in both the `PlantCard` and `FieldMap` components. You might want to consider moving this function to a utility file and importing it into both components to avoid duplication.

6. **API Base URL**: The base URL for your API is hardcoded in the `api.js` file. You might want to consider moving this to a configuration file or using environment variables so that it can be easily changed without modifying the code.

7. **Status**: In the `PlantCard` component, you are displaying the `plant.status` but it is not clear what this status is or where it is coming from. You might want to consider adding some comments to explain this or using a more descriptive name.

8. **Responsive Design**: You might want to consider making your design responsive so that it looks good on all screen sizes. This can be done using media queries in your CSS.

9. **Testing**: Consider adding tests for your components and API calls. This will help ensure that your application is working as expected and will make it easier to make changes in the future.

10. **Comments**: Consider adding comments to your code to explain what each part is doing. This will make it easier for others (or yourself in the future) to understand the code.

11. **Gradient Background**: As you mentioned earlier, you can add a nice gradient background to your site by updating the CSS. For example, you can update the `src/index.css` file to add a gradient background for your entire application.
